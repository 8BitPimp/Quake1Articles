This archive contains the source code for a sample system to render
3-D scenes to illustrate 3-D clipping, as discussed in my "Ramblings
in Realtime" column in the March/April 1995 issue of _Dr. Dobb's
Sourcebook_.  The archive contains the source code for CLIP, a C
program that contains a small 3-D graphics engine to demonstrate 3-D
clipping.  Both programs are Win32 programs, tested with VC++ 2.0
running on Windows NT 3.5.

To make the VC++ projects for this program, just unzip this archive
into the desired directory using the -d switch to pkunzip; it will
create a windebug subdirectory.  Have VC++ build a project from the
files in the directory.  Besides the source code, the Win32
executable clip.exe is provided in the WinDebug subdirectory.  Key
commands to clip.exe are as follows:

left and right arrows: turn left and right
up and down arrows: go forward and backward
A and D: look up and down
N and M: roll left and right
D and C: move up and down

Thanks to Chris Hecker, John Carmack, and Eric Kutter for their help.

Enjoy!
