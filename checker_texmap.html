<H3>The articles</H3>

<P>
In 1995, Chris Hecker started an article series on
"Perspective Texture Mapping" in the
<A HREF="http://www.gdmag.com/">Game Developer magazine</A>,
published by
<A HEEF="http://www.mfi.com/">Miller Freeman</A>. The series
is finished by now. The articles in question
as published in the "Under the Hood/Behind the Screen" column
are:

<UL>
<LI>"Part I - Foundations", April/May 95, pp. 16-25
<LI>"Part II - Rasterization", June/July 95, pp. 18-26
<LI>"Part III - Endpoints and Mapping", August/September 95, pp. 17-24
<LI>"Part IV - Approximations", December 95/January 96, pp. 19-25
<LI>"Part V - It's About Time", April/May 96, pp. 25-33 
</UL>

I received the back issues for Part I-III. MFI will hopefully
deliver soon the Part IV issue 
on scanline subdivision, and Part V issue which contains the
discussion of an example of a pipelined
floating point texture mapper as invented by Michael Abrash.
Another issue 
I got lays the foundations to the floating point approach 
<UL>
<LI> "Let's Get to the (Floating) Point", February/March 96, pp. 19-24
</UL>
Back issues can be
<A HREF="http://www.gdmag.com/torder.htm">ordered</A> from MFI.
</P>

<H3>The Source</H3>

<P>
The C++ sample sources are all available from the MFI
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.mfi.com/pub/gamedev/src/">FTP site</A>.
In the archives of the respective issues, you will find

<UL>
<LI>The april 1995 listing that
    demonstrates how to write a high quality C++ implementation,
    that is slow due to two multiplies and one division per pixel.
<LI>The june 1995 listing that provides changes to above listing
    for an integer rasterizer.
<LI>The august 1995 listing that provides changes again to above
    listings, for use of fractional endpoints.
</UL>
</P>

<P>
It is recommended to use the final version of the texture mapper 
that has been released
with the April/May 1996 issue, and available on the sites mentioned
above. It includes the following files:

<H2>Overview of the articles</H2>

<P>
This article series is important and recommended for two reasons:
Firstly, from what I have read so far, it is the best comprehensive
discussion of perspective texture mapping to be found, including
lots and lots of practical issues and an implementation. The theory 
is surely covered best in sources like 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/ph/www/heckbert.html">
Paul Heckbert's Master Thesis</A>, or
books like 
<A HREF="#Wolberg">"Digital Image Warping" by George Wolberg</A>,
but all
you need for a very good start is here.
Secondly, the parts I do not (yet) have available reportedly 
discuss the ideas and the details of a P5-specific optimization
of the fast inner loop that has been invented by Michael Abrash.
Let's look at what goodies are available.
</P>


<H3>Part I: Foundations</H3>

<P>
Included are discussions of definitions and concepts, such as
perspective projection, forward mapping, backward or inverse
mapping, affine mapping and its drawbacks, linearity of 1/z
in screen space, interpolation and triangle gradients,
polygon fill conventions, sampling from pixel center and
pre-stepping.
</P>

<H3>Part II: Rasterization</H3>

<P>
This article focuses on triangle rasterization, again with
top-left fill convention, lighting all pixels strictly inside
the polygon boundaries and pixels exactly on top or left
edge boundaries. Instead of the straight floating point
implementation used in the previous issue, this time an
integer approach is discussed. Chris Hecker provides
insights in the floor() and ceil() conversion functions, 
forward differences, and a side remark in the annoying
implementation dependance of the ANSI C mod operator.
He discusses use of error-term DDA instead
of fixed-point rasterization to scan the edges, with
respect to jump predicition failures, taking into account
the sampling from pixel center and the pre-stepping.
</P>

<H3>Part III: Endpoints and Mapping</H3>

<P>
In his previous article, Chris Hecker concluded mentioning
another failure of many texture mappers, namely jerkiness due to
using integer endpoints to compute the triangle gradients.
To remove this visible jitter, he now takes a close looks
at fractional endpoints and their advantages for mapping
purposes, and their importance for subdivision approximations
of perspective correct texture mapping. He selects a
28.4 fixed point format for representing fractional
endpoints, and develops in detail a fixed-point initialized
error-term DDA to replace the integer intialized one.
</P>

<P>
In addition, he describes a subtle bug in the
computing the integer coordinates in the source texture
(of the texel)  from the real texture coordinates for the center
of a given screen pixel, and sets off to an in-depth
discussion of truncating and rounding as involved in 
defining a mapping rule from real source coordinates to
integer source coordinates. This bug affects the sampling
dependend on texture direction, i.e. rotation affects
visual appearance.
In the <A HREF="/dEngine/archive/gdev/texture.zip">archive</A>
you will find the <code>gradient.txt</code> file discussing
how to choose the appropriate rounding rule.
</P>

<H3>Part IV/V</H3>

<P>
I am hoping for MFI getting them delivered any time soon.
</P>


<H2>Quake's Texture Mapping</H2>

<P>
The floating point pipeling code for the texture mapping inner loop
described in the articles exploits the fact that the P5 architecture
allows for scheduling integer and floating operations in parallel,
and effectively reduces computation to 4 cycles/pixel in best
case.
</P>

<P>
The article series does not mention Quake, and the details of the
implementation id's rasterizer is acutally using might differ.
In his CGDC talk, Michael Abrash stated that screen gradients for
texture coordinates and 1/z are used to calculate perspective correct
texture coordinates every 8 or 16 pixels, and linear interpolation is
used between those points. He characterized the loop to be 
100% floating-point down to the 8 or 16 pixel subdivisions, and
mentions overlapping FDIV. In summary, their inner loop is clearly
faster in floating-point on Pentium than it would be in fixed-point. 
</P>

<P>
Btw., the z-fill that is done by the Quake rasterizer while
processing world BSP polygons is not done within the same loop as
the perspective texture mapping, because of the ever present lack
of general purpose registers on the Intel x86 architecture, as
pointed out to me by Chris Hecker and confirmed by John Carmack.
</P>
