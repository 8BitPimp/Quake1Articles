<H2>The Quake Graphics Engine</H2>

<P>
by Michael Abrash, id Software.
</P>


<P>
<strong>WARNING! - Explicit technical content!!</strong><br><br>

A highly technical look inside the design of the Quake 
graphics engine.<br><br>

1 hour != 12 months<br><br>

Idea is to give you benefit of our real-world experience 
to help you up the learning curve.
</P>

<HR>

<P>
<em>"Pretty soon, computers will be fast." -Billy Zelsnack </em><br><br>

Hardware isn't as fast as we'd like for realtime 3-D, 
and isn't going to be for a long time.<br><br>

Hard frame-rate constraints.
</P>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Fun thing #1: hardware is fast enough to do interesting things, 
but not fast enough to do what we really want.<br><br>

<LI>Fun thing #2: a ton of techniques and approaches, all of which 
are good for something, none of which are good for everything.<br><br>

</UL>

Balancing act between visual quality and speed, all with the 
frame rate limit as a hard constraint--and it all changes every 
year as hardware moves forward.
</P>

<HR>

<H3>Objectives:</H3>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Quake:
    <UL>
    <LI>True, arbitrary 6 DOF 3-D.
    <LI>Highest possible graphics quality,
        both lighting and rasterizing.
    <LI>True 3-D for players, monsters, and
        as many objects as possible.
    </UL>
<LI>Any 3-D engine:
    <UL>
    <LI>Correct color at each pixel.
    <LI>Adequate, reasonably level framerate.
    </UL>
</UL>

For our purposes, that means sampling the right pixel from the 
polygon that's nearest at that pixel, and doing so 
at 10-15 frame/second minimum.

</P>

<HR>

<H4>Problems</H4>
<P>
It would be nice to be able to chuck all the polygons at a 
rasterizer that was so fast that we didn't have to think any further.<br><br>

Problem: no such rasterizer.<br><br>

Bigger problem: level designers would just use more polygons.<br><br>

The number of polygons goes up very fast with larger/more complex 
worlds, much more than linearly, though the number of visible 
polygons may not.<br><br>

Problem of rejecting polygons outside the view pyramid, 
and frame rate variation.<br><br>
</P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Principle #1:<br>
    we need to reduce the polygon set quickly to only 
    those that matter, or at least those that have a pretty good chance 
    of mattering.<br><br>

<LI>Principle #2:<br>
    we need to get the right colors on the right pixels 
    for those polygons we do draw; this means perspective correction, 
    z-ordering, shading, subpixel and subtexel placement, and so on.
</UL>

#2 has been the focus for a long time, but #1 is quickly becoming the
real challenge. Both must be done well in order to build a compelling
engine.
</P>

<HR>


<H3>Two parts to the Quake graphics engine:</H3>
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Static world.
<LI>Everything else (moving objects, including players, monsters, doors, 
    platforms, health, ammo, armor, and so on).
</UL>

These are handled very differently.
</P>

<P>
<H4>The static world.</H4>

Big (up to around 10,000 large polygons), with a continuous polygon 
mesh skin and any number of light sources.<br><br>

Can be preprocessed very effectively.<br><br>

Is compiled into a single BSP tree.
</P>

<HR>

<H3>Handy facts about BSP trees:</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Nodes are splitting planes, with polygons stored on them, that 
    carve up space.
<LI>Leaves are the convex volumes that nodes carve the world into.
<LI>A BSP tree can be walked front-to-back or back-to-front in linear 
    time for any viewpoint.
<LI>A BSP tree performs a convex, hierarchical partitioning of space, 
    with each node defining a subspace that contains all of the node's 
    children.
<LI>Hierarchical partitioning helps greatly in large-scale culling.  
    Node bounding boxes can be clipped to the view pyramid.
<LI>If a node's bounding box is trivially rejected, all its children 
    can be rejected with no further testing.
<LI>If a node is trivially accepted, all its children can be accepted 
    with no further testing.
</UL>
</P>

<HR>


<H4>The other part of large-scale culling:</H4>

<P>
  culling polygons that are 
in the view pyramid but are totally obscured.  
Some of the techniques that were considered and/or tried:

<UL>
<LI>Z-buffering
<LI>Painters algorithm
<LI>Beam tree
<LI>Subdividing raycasting
<LI>Edge or span sorting
<LI>Portals
<LI>Direct visibility extraction from BSP
</UL>

In every case, some average performance impact, considerable 
worst-case impact, so frame rate wasn't very level.
</P>

<HR>

<H3>Precalculate the PVS!</H3>

Precalculated the PVS from each leaf to each leaf.

<UL>
<LI>Virtually free at runtime.
<LI>Very expensive to precalculate - but that's what preprocessing 
     is for.
<LI>Speeds up culling to the view pyramid and determination of 
    moving objects that have to be drawn, because only nodes and 
    leaves in the PVS matter.
</UL>
</P>

<HR>

<H4>Frame rate</H4>

<P>
Frame rate was still not level enough, because of overdraw.<br><br>

Added another stage, edge sorting, to process the polygons 
in the PVS.<br><br>

Add edges to global table, process all edges at once, top to 
bottom, emit nearest spans.  Later, draw the spans for each surface 
in turn.<br><br>

Extra sorting work, but reduced overdraw to zero, levelling 
performance a great deal.<br><br>

Other benefits:

<UL>
<LI>Shared edges
<LI>Concave polygons
<LI>Culling of polygons for 3-D hw
</UL>
</P>

<P>
What key to sort on?

<UL>
<LI>BSP order.
<LI>1/z.
</UL>

BSP order. BSPs contain more implicit information that you might think.
</P>

<HR>

<H3>Rasterization!</H3>

<P>
Disadvantages of normal Gouraud shaded texture mapping:

<UL>
<LI>Rotational lighting variance if
   triangles aren't used.

<LI>Lighting detail is added by adding
   more polygons.

<LI>Lighting is not perspective correct.
</UL>

Solution: surface caching
</P>

<P>
Each surface is generated from a combination of a tiled texture and a 
light map with light values on a 16-pixel grid.<br><br>

This is cached and used as the source texture for a non-shading 
texture mapper.<br><br>

The light map is precalculated with ray casting from lights to each 
grid point on each surface.  Radiosity would be possible.<br><br>

Per-surface mipmapping helps keep the total cache size down, and also 
improves appearance at a distance.
</P>

<P>
Advantages:

<UL>
<LI>No rotational variance.
<LI>Perspective correct lighting.
<LI>Fewer polgyons.
<LI>Lighting separated from polygons.
<LI>Ability to post-process.
</UL>


Disadvantages:

<UL>
<LI>More memory.
<LI>More cache misses.
<LI>Slow for constantly changing lighting
   (fine for switching lighting on/off).
<LI>Slowdown when turning corners.
<LI>Not a perfect fit for hardware.
</UL>
<P>

<HR>

<P>
<H3>Time to draw!</H3>

There's a span drawer that takes the list of spans for a surface 
and draws the pixels.<br><br>

No lighting is performed.<br><br>

The screen gradients for the texture coordinates and 1/z are used 
to calculate perspective correct texture coordinates every 8 or 16 
pixels, and linear interpolation is used between those points.<br><br>
</P>


<P>
100% floating-point down to the 8 or 16 pixel subdivisions.<br><br>

Hurts on 486, but Pentium floating-point is fast, and floating-point 
solves all sorts of range and scale problems, and allows both 
lowering FDIV precision and overlapping FDIV.  Also, using FP 
registers frees up integer registers.<br><br>

All in all, our inner loop is clearly faster in floating-point on 
Pentium than it would be in fixed-point.
</P>

<HR>

<H3>Everything else--moving entities.</H3>

<P>
There are several types of entities, stored as BSP trees, polygon 
meshes, sprites, and particles.<br><br>

Large-scale culling benefits for entities:  Each entity's bounding 
box is clipped into the world BSP.<br><br>

Only if it touches a PVS leaf is it flagged for later drawing, 
after the world has been processed.<br><br>

Separate BSP models, such as doors, platforms, and health and ammo 
boxes, are clipped into the world BSP, then added to the global edge 
table, just like world polygons.<br><br>

Doors block view past them, reducing overdraw considerably.<br><br>

BSP models in the same leaf fall back to sorting against each 
other on 1/z.
</P>


<HR>


<H4>More complex objects</H4>
<P>

More complex objects, such as torches, armor, and players can't be 
done with BSPs.<br><br>

Sprites look startlingly non-3D in a Quake level; they're rare now, 
and may disappear entirely, but are an easy solution for objects 
like torches.<br><br>
</P>

<P>
We had been clipping sprites into the world BSP and drawing the 
pieces by their leaves' BSP order, drawing back to front.<br><br>

That approach didn't work so well for polygon models--players 
and monsters.
</P>

<P>
Polygon models are meshes of 100-400 polygons, with a single 
front/back skin stretched over them.<br><br>

We couldn't clip them to the world BSP, because it would be too 
expensive, so we just drew each triangle in the nearest leaf it 
had a vertex in, which caused occasional errors.<br><br>

Errors sorting polygons within models.<br><br>

Errors sorting between models in same leaf (and also with other 
BSP models and sprites).<br><br>
</P>

<HR>


<H4>Z-Buffer</H4>
<P>

Tried lots of tweaks (such as putting into edge list), but none was 
satisfactory until John came up with a sweeping solution:<br><br>

Uh... <strong>Z-buffering</strong><br><br>

We z-buffer sprites, polygon models, and all other non-BSP entities.<br><br>

How low-tech can you get?
</P>

<P>
Solved all sorting problems for moving entities with NO sorting 
errors ever.<br><br>

Fits beautifully into overall design.<br><br>

Because of no-overdraw spans, can z-fill world at an adequate speed.<br><br>

Allows post-processing.  At the moment, we're doing particles, 
scaled NxN colored rectangles, but could do pretty much anything.<br><br>

Low-tech, high-tech, whatever; the secret's in the mixing and matching 
until it all fits.
<P>

<HR>


<H3>In conclusion:</H3>

<P>
The more 3-D tricks you know, and the more you experiment, the better.<br><br>

Yes, I <strong>could</strong> use a vacation.<br><br>

Sharing knowledge makes the world a better place.<br><br>
</P>
