</PRE>


In this article Michael Abrash discusses the Hidden Surface Removal (HSR)
that still has to follow the Visible Surface Determination he (VSD)
described in an 
<A HREF="ddjpvs.html">earlier arcticle</A>. 


<H2>Moving objects and a z-buffer</H2>

<P>
He starts with some remarks on the problems of handling moving
objects (billboards/sprites, BSP models like doors, items,
polygon models) with a BSP, and the solution revealed in his
<A HREF="mikeab-cgdc.html">CGDC talk</A>: 
using a z-buffer.
The BSP provides all polygons of the static world in a perfectly
sorted order. This could be used to z-fill the z-buffer (saving
a separate z-buffer clear) without read/compare. He states that
the performance impact for this pass is about 10 percent. Note
that this pass has to be done separately from actually
texture mapping the polygons in question (which involves a
z-calculation per pixel, too, for perspective correct texture
mapping), due to the lack of registers with i586 processors.
</P>
<P>
If I understood correctly, the z-buffer is actually used for
billboards (sprites) and polygon models (whose triangles
potentially could intersect) and special effects introduced
later (once the z-buffer was already in) like particles. BSP
models are handled diffently (see 
<A HREF="#BSPmodels">below</A>).
The z-read/compare/write
performance impact is reported to vary a lot, averaging
to about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the memory footprint is about 128K for 320x200. According
to this, the same 16bit z-buffer depth uses 1.3MB with the 960x720
modes I am occasionally running with Linux/XFree86. This sounds
like much, but according to Michael Abrash, the game requires 8MB
anyway, and the surface cache is likely to use a lot more if only
available.
</P>

<H2>Level performance and Sorted Spans</H2>

<P>
The back-to-front approach to render the static world which John
Carmack tried with the PVS did not provide level performance because
of varying overdraw. I guess back-to-front rendering with painters
algorithm is not a useful approach for scalable, densely occluded
environments anyway. Michael Abrash states that they considered
a beam-tree like approach (I wonder whether Weiler-Atherton clipping
would be a good idea), and discarded it, because they already tried
it for
<A HREF="ddjpvs.html">Visible Surface Determination</A>,
and it suffered from overhead and varying performance.
</P>

<P>
In consequence, they decided to solve the HSR task on span-level
instead of polygon level. He sketches the bsic idea of sorted
spans, and discusses two alternatives: edge sorting or span sorting.
I do not know much about the latter, and will not attempt to
summarize his explanation of the former - a good description of
Active Edges based rendering can be found in Foley, van Dam et.al, in
the VSD/Scan-Line section. Btw., Chris Laurels "wt" and the
<A HREf="/dEngine/r95/">scanline-based renderer</A> we wrote used
a modified edge-sorted rasterizer - with DOOM-style restrictions
it is a good idea to rotate by 90 degrees, to draw wall spans in
the most efficient way.
</P>
<P>
Following the overview of both approaches, he summarizes that
there does not seem to be a conclusive answer which technique
to prefer. For Quake, they decided to use an edge-sorted
rasterizer with some advantages:
<UL>
<LI>horizontal coherence allowing for quick sorting
<LI>edges can be shared between adjacent polygons
<LI>concave polygons are possible
</UL>
The details of the exge-sorted rasterizer will be described
in the July/August issue of
<A HREF="http://www.ddj.com/">Dr. Dobbs Sourcebook</A>. The
<A HREF="ddjzsort/">source</A> has been available since march.
</P>


<H2>Some Basics of Edge Sorting</H2>

<P>
The remainder of the article covers some details. Abrash explains
that using 1/z instead of z as a sorting key has various
advantages:
<UL>
<LI>1/z is linear in screen space
<LI>increasing resolution with decreasing distance
</UL>
He refers the reader to Chris Hecker's much recommended 
<A HREF="checker_texmap.html">series on Texture Mapping</A>
in the 
<A HREF="http://www.gdmag.com/">Game Developer's Magazine</A> with
respect to the behaviour of z gradients in various spaces. The alternative
he goes into is using the order given by the BSP traversal 
to assign keys. The did this in fact with Quake, but were using
1/z keys at the time the article was written. Abrash comments that
the decision might well happen the last days before they ship.
The disadvantage of BSP-based keys is that moving BSP objects have
to be split by world BSP planes, which increases the number of
polygons. Using 1/z sorting, it is not necessary to split BSP
model polygins. In addition, the 1/z key solves merging the
BSP model drawing order in the world BSP drawing order (which
ideally breaks down to merging two already sorted lists, methinks). 
</P>

<P>
He finishes by explaining how to obtain an 1/z value and an arbitrary
point on the polygon in an efficient way, using a plane equation
in terms of viewspace z and screen space x,y, and gives the approximate
costs on a Pentium as about six cycles.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="BSPmodels">Handling BSP Models</A></H2>

<P>
As stated above, the BSP models are not rendered using a z-buffer
read/compare. BSP objects therefore provide overdraw reduction - doors,
most notably, block any surface behind them in the edge-sorted
rasterizer. In consequence, BSP models have to be clipped against
world polygons, to avoid interpenetrations (I wonder if a
sufficiently large bounding box for wall-object collision detection
is not sufficient). This is not necessary for polygon models and
billboards and particles, as z-compares account for intersections.
This is obvious from passable lava/water surfaces.

quite some time already, and there is a
<A HREF="/dEngine/archive/ddj/ddjzsort.zip">local copy</A>
with permission. Remarks by Michael Abrash:
<PRE>
   Note: In this implementation, polygon faces must not be
   interpenetrating. Also, correct sorting is not guaranteed
   if two polygonal objects butt up against each other. In other
   words, each polygonal object must be made of a continuous,
   non-self-intersecting skin, and polygonal objects must not
   interpenetrate or touch in order for proper sorting to result.
   More complex, slower sorting is required to make those cases
   work reliably.
   
   Note: polygon processing could be considerably more efficient
   if polygons shared common edges and edges shared common vertices.
   Also, indirection to vertices could be used to avoid having to
   copy all the vertices during every clip test. Outcode-type
   testing could be used to determine completely clipped or
   unclipped polygons ahead of time, avoiding the need to clip and
   copy entirely for such polygons. Outcode-type tests work best in
   viewspace, with the frustum normalized so that the field of view
   is 90 degrees, so simple compares, rather than dot products, can
   be used to categorize points with respect to the frustum.
