Inside Quake: Visible Surface Determination

<P>
An
<A HREF="/dEngine/quake/archive/a_march96/">e-mail</A>
by Derek Nickel mentioned the follwing article:

<PRE>
   Michael Abrash, "Inside Quake: Visible-Surface Determination"
   In: Dr. Dobb's Sourcebook, January/February 1996, #255
       Ramblings In Real Time, pp. 41-45
</PRE>

This article talks about pushing past the unconscious limits that are often
set in a project. It then goes on to describe the various techniques that
John Carmack tried out while developing his visible-surface determination
and culling algorithms (VSD) in Quake. This includes a description of the 
potentially visible set (PVS) , a.k.a. visibility lists, on page 45.

<H2>BSP-based culling</H2>

<P>
Michael Abrash points out that, with the limited tasks of rasterization
like perspective correct texture mapping being moved into hardware,
VSD will prove to be the biggest challenge for coders. Spatial
subdivision is one approach, and he mentions the representation of
Quake levels as 3D BSP, and points out that this BSP, unlike the one
he discussed in previous columns in 1995, does not store polygons in
tree nodes, but in the leafs (which, if I understand correctly, is
not different from the 2D BSP DOOM used).
</P>

<P>
He then explains the culling of polygons completely outside the
view frustrum, and points out the advantages of culling entire
BSP subtress, which requires maintaning bounding boxes or spheres
with each node. This, again, is a technique used with DOOM already.
</P>


<H2>Overdraw</H2>

<P>
The problem of overdraw is most obvious with back-to-front BSP
traversal an painter algorithm. Your world is not rendered in
a scalable way, and performance will not only be slow, but worse,
it will not be level. He mentions that, with a 10000 polygon
Quake level, a wortst-case overdraw of ten times or more was not
rare.
</P>

<P>
To solve this problem, and to reduce overdraw to a manageable
and, more important, level magnitude, John Carmack tried a
multitude of approaches:
<UL>
<LI>Beam tree (view frstrum subdivision by hierarchy of clipping planes)
<LI>Subdividing raycast (8x8 pixel grids)
<LI>Vertex-free surfaces (infinite plane representations)
<LI>Draw buffer (a 1-bit "already drawn" flag buffer)
<LI>Span-based drawing (see <A HREF="ddjzsort.html">later article</A>)
<LI>Portals(see Seth Teller's PhD, reference below)
</UL>
</P>

<H2>Potentially Visible Sets</H2>

<P>
The final solution found by John Carmack was a precalculated
lookup, providing for each leaf of the BSP a list of
potentially visible leafs (the PVS). This again requires
the world to be static, and it does not take the direction
of view into account (a common misconception with BSP trees
as well). A raw PVS is quite large (Abrash mentions several
megabyte), but RLE compression and modifications to the
BSP builder brought the size down to 20K. The modifications
he names are:
<UL>
<LI>changing the split choosing heuristic
<LI>sealing the map
</UL>
Here sealing means calculating some hull of the world to
determine surfaces that are not visible from anywhere
within the world, and removing them. The idea of Quake-style
rendering is being inside a densely occulded world, and
a sealing process makes perfect sense. It is related
to the Brush based CSG modeling used by QuakeEd
(see
<A HREF="/dEngine/quake/">references on MAP editing</A>
for details). Seth Teller mentions a preprocessing
step to identify small gaps and other leakage by polygons
that are not perfectly adjacent, map faults that increase
PVS size immensely.
</P>
<P>
The BSP heuristic should be changed to generate fewer leaves,
prefering the polygons that splits the fewest other
polygons. This will generate less balanced trees, which is
not a severe disdavantage in this case, if I remember correctly.
</P>
